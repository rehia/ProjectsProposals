PorteOuverte

**November 18, 2015**

# Overview

During events in Paris on November 13, people that were in the streets, called seekers (?), close to the scene of the shooting, were trying to hide somewhere, to avoid being shot.

Spontaneously, people that were living here, called hosts, proposed to "open their door", to help seekers hide. The initiative #PorteOuverte on Twitter appeared.

As developer of Tweetping service, we created a stream on #Porteouverte hashtag to map those tweets, to help seekers localise the "open doors". Tweetping could be helpful, but it was not "optimised" to be as efficient as possible. Some hosts were not so keen on geolocalising their tweets. And we noticed some improvements that could raise the efficiency of such initiative, and still keep people secured.

# Goals

1. **Find a #PorteOuverte** Help seekers to quickly locate a place to hide
2. **Declare a #PorteOuverte** Help hosts to declare their place as available without having to geocalise
3. **Connect people** Help both get in touch securely 

# Ideas

After tweetping's experience, we noticed a lot of noise due to retweets, and tweets talking about the initiative without actually trying to find a place or declaring a place. It could be interesting to find a way to reduce noise, and thus raise efficiency.

For tweetping to be really helpful, hosts needed to geocalise precisely their tweets, which became hard with twitter applications. We could still browse tweets, and try to guess hosts'address, even not precised ones like just a street name, by scanning tweets with possible location information, and then map this as precise as possible.

We could provide an app where seekers can geolocalise themselves, and find possible hosts around them. We also have to find a way to help seekers get in touch quickly, and securely with hosts.

That's basically what I had in mind. And theses are only hypothesis.
